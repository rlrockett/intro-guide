Many view **The Bible** as one of the most influential books ever written, but it is also one of the most disputed works as well. The Bible is one of those subjects that a majority of people have a strong opinion about, both positive and negavite. It is these strong emotonial ties that make the Bible a perfect fit to the subject of a _historiographical study_. This essay will take a glance at two major aspects of historiography. First we will take a closer look at the historians who researched and wrote about the Bible. Then go through a brief timeline of how perspectives and interpretations of the Bible have changed over time, specifically in terms of how developments in science have shifted     

### Prophets to Historians

Looking at the Bible

  source-url="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentrism"

A perfect example of this is the Roman’s belief in [**Geocentrism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geocentric_model), thinking that the Earth is the center of the Universe with the sun orbiting around it. They believed this because they took what the Bible said literally. There are multiple verses in the Bible that led them to believe in Geocentrism, but the main one that they used was Joshua 10:13: “And the sun stood still and the moon stayed, until the people had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.” 

This belief went unchallenged for a while because it was written in the scriptures, and in those days no one dared to go against the Bible or the Church. If you haven’t already guessed, that is foreshadowing for someone to do the unthinkable and challenge the Church. The person to do this was [**Galileo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei).

Galileo made some observations of the moon's shape and the craters or valleys located on it. He also observed the milky way and distant bright dots around Jupiter, which he later discovered was moons. All of these factored into Galileo coming to the conclusion that the earth is not the center of the Universe. He made a [**Heliocentrism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism) claim, that the sun is the center of the Universe.

_Galileo_ knew that this new thought process would ruffle some feathers, so he sent private letters before going public to get a sense of the reaction he would get. In one of these letters, known as the [_Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_to_the_Grand_Duchess_Christina), he argues that the Bible should be taken as incapable of making mistakes, when understood correctly, and it has little to say in matters of astronomy. “I think that in discussions of physical problems we ought to begin not from the authority of scriptural passages, but from sense-experiences and necessary demonstrations.” (Blackwell, pg 6)

%}

Despite his best efforts, Galileo still faced the wrath of the church; and they forced him to publicly recant his claims. To be clear, the Church did not have _scientific problems_ with what Galileo was claiming. They had no other evidence, or reason to think different from this claim, other than what they thought the Bible was saying. The church had a problem with him defying the final authority of the church.  Galileo did as he was asked, but the damage was done and the seeds of doubt about how to understand the Bible were planted. 

This is what is referred by many as the **Conflict theory**. “On this view, Christianity is cast in the role of the oppressive and stultifying stepmother who held back the young, reasonable, and progressive maiden of science. Then science finally broke free from the oppressive Church and steadily added to our accumulated knowledge and quality of life.” (Stump, pg 3)

### Independence, calm before the storm 

Galileo’s discovery and claims against the literal interpretation of the Bible forced a major shift in the way that Science and the Bible interacted. This interaction is classified as **Independence**, and is where they both go their separate ways while not intersecting. “At other times in the history of Science and Christianity, the two sides were content to go about their own business without interfering with each other.” (Stump, pg 8)

%}

Even the authority of the Church got on board with the Independence era. [**Basil the Great**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_of_Caesarea), an influential bishop at the time, dismissed Greek science as ‘idle chatter’ which was ‘not all useful for the edification of the Church’. (Harrison, pg 12) [**Ambrose**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambrose), the archbishop of Milan, explaining why the scriptures had little say on scientific matter, wrote, “There was no place in the words of the Holy Spirit for the vanity of perishable knowledge which deceives and deludes us in our attempt to explain the unexplainable." (Harrison, pg 13) [**Saint Augustine**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustine_of_Hippo), a major Christian philosopher, was hardly more enthusiastic, declaring that ‘the knowledge collected from the books of pagans, although some of it is useful, is also little as compared with that derived from scripture.’ (Harrison, pg 13) 

This idea, of keeping the science and the Bible in their sectors, is an idea that is also shared by some in the modern day setting. In 1829, Leading theologian, _Moses Stuart of Andover Seminary_, stated, "God fit the world of the Mosaic narrative to the feeling, vies, and methods of expression, existing in the time of Moses… The bible was not designed to teach the Hebrews astronomy or geology.” (Goldberg, pg 28-29)

### Different Ways of Interepting the Bible

Along with this era of **independence** and the many advances in science Biblical philosophy was pushed into a different direction when looking at and trying to understand the Bible. The shift was away from the literal translation that dominated in Ancient Rome. This change in thought was highlighted by **Averroes** and his **double truth theory**. Averroes was a muslim philosopher, and one of the most important Arab thinkers of the Middle ages. “The doctrine of double truth meant that a claim could have different meanings at different levels- a literal philosophical meaning and an allegorical or figurative theological meaning.” (Stump, pg 9)

[**Origen of Alexandria**](https://www.iep.utm.edu/origen-of-alexandria/) was one of the great Christian theologians of his time and he was also on the side of getting away from a literal interpretation. Origen had argued that both the world and scripture have embedded within them potent symbols. “The relationship (between the invisible and the visibly) does not obtain only with creatures, the Divine Scripture itself is written with wisdom of a rather similar sort.” (Harrison, pg 19) Origen made a claim that certain passages of scripture have no literal sense at all, and that others, when taken literally, could reasonably be dismissed as ‘absurd and impossible.’ (Harrison, pg 19)

The step away from the literal interpretation left a gap in the Bible and its relationship to the natural world. This gap was quickly filled in by the **Two Books** metaphor. This metaphor states that God gave mankind information, or revelation, through different, but coordinated sources. The first source is the Bible, while the other one is the world (God’s creation). This metaphor appealed to the masses because not everyone knew how to read, or had the scriptures available to them, however one does not need to know how to read to observe the beauty of God’s creation.

Multiple Christian theologians and scholars supported this metaphor. [**John Chrysostom**]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Chrysostomwas) the Archbishop of Constantinople and was one of the main figures to support this idea. “If God had given instruction by means of books, and of letter, he who knew letters would have learnt what was written, but the illiterate man would have gone away without receiving any benefit… This however cannot be said with respect to the heavens and every man that walks upon the earth, shall hear this voice; for not by means of the ears, but through the sight, it reaches our understanding.” (Stump, pg 12)

All of these paradigm shifts or changing of philosphies of looking at the Bible was spurned on by the advancement of knowledge in the pursuit of science. The more that was understood about the world the more the persception of the Bible changed. It was this strong connection to the natural world and the emphasis on God’s creation that led to the biggest battle science or the Bible has ever seen.

### Evolution

%}  

The developments of science led to advances and a wealth of knowledge about the world that we live in. This was highlighted by the [**Darwin’s theory of evolution**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darwinism). Darwin’s theory was the start of science’s direct challenge to the Bible’s account of God being the ultimate creator of the world. The challenge sparked a war between an unmovable object and an unstoppable force. Science and the Bible go head to head in a battle that is still being fought to this very day. 

When we talk about **Darwin’s theory of evolution**, it is key to know that there are plenty, on both sides of the fence, that have problems with the part that suggests humans evolved from monkeys; so that doesn’t factor into this discussion. We can also throw out the tension between these two in regards to evolution. It is obvious that humans, and many species of animals, have adapted and changed over time. The Bible would argue that the adaptation that we have seen over the years is part of God's [**intelligent design**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_design), part of his plan. Science would counter by pointing out flaws in the proposed intelligent design; such as the jaw seemingly not designed to adequately fit all of the human adult teeth, whichrequires the removal of ones wisdom teeth. This theory would be and still is a thorn in the Church's side and would slowly make its way into the ultimate discussion of how did we get here?

### Evolution Theory Gains Traction

This battle hit the headlines in America in 1925, when a Tennessee school teacher, [**John Scopes**](https://www.history.com/topics/roaring-twenties/scopes-trial), taught evolution. The trial of John Scopes made national news, and pushed this battle into the minds of the public. This was such a shock to many people because of the strong Biblical roots that American was founded on. The Bible was also a major part of how society in the 1920's was shaped. Most American's didn't give the thought that God created the earth a second thought. For someone as trusted as a schoolteacher to teach their children, the youth of America, a different story filled them shock and a bit of anger. This trail was a apetizer for the main battle to come.    

### Big Bang Theory

%}

While Darwin's Theory of Evolution tried to fill in blanks of where humans came from science needed a answer for the where the Earth and the galaxy came from, enter the **big bang theory**.  This theory is based on a random cosmic explosion of a subatomic ball that hurled matter and energy in different directions. Over long period of time, projected 10 billion years, the matter and energy evolved into stars, galaxies, and planets. Those on the Bible side of things would counter that the event science claims the big bang, was actually God creating the earth from nothing. This is just the start of the disagreement. 

### AGE IS MORE THAN JUST A NUMBER

  source-url="https://creation.com/can-christians-add-big-bang-to-bible"
%}

Another point of conflict is the age of the earth. For the earth to fit into the **big bang theory**, the earth would have required millions of years to have evolved from nothing into life as we know it today. For **creation theorists**, they paint the earth in a much younger time span. Even those in the Christian community argue over taking the story of creation literally; as God created the earth in six, 24 hour, days. In this scenario the first book of the Bible, Genesis, is looked at as a histrocal source of how the world came about.   

The [**Gap theory**](https://biblicalscienceinstitute.com/uncategorized/the-gap-theory/), came about in response to the huge disparity of the earth's age between evolution, science, and creation, the Bible. In an attempt to bridge this major gap some in the Christian community theorized that there was a significant amount of time between Gensis 1:1 (God creating the heavens and earth) and Gensis 1:2 (the Earth being formless, empty, and covered in darkness). This theory has minimal supporters in the Christian community, but it is interesting to see how science has once again influenced the lens through which the Bible is trying to be viewed.

With all of that said, there is no way on earth that science, or the Bible, can prove their own theories without a shadow of doubt; this battle will continue until the end of time. Some have voiced their opinions that the Bible, and Christianity, may have bitten off more than they can chew by trying to validate the _Bible using scientific means_. As the evangelical writer and religion professor **Randall Balmer** points out, confronting the public with objective evidence, attempting to show proff, of the Bible as literal truth is a mistake. “Paradoxically, when the Religious Right asserts intelligent design is science, it implies that faith in God is… inadequate, that it needs the imprimatur of the scientific method.” (Krattenmaker) “I rather see that religious beliefs should seek justification on the solid rocks of faith and revelation, not on scientific knowledge, which by its very nature is never definitive or forever valid. (Ayala, pg 76)

### Can They Coexist?

With everything that has transpired between Science and the Bible, it is fair that think that they have trust issues with each other; but moving forward, it seems best to put the past behind them. To get the most out of this relationship, it seems there to be a middle ground moving forward, and the first step involves each side understanding their roles. “Of course, in their search for the truth science and religion are exploring different dimensions of the human encounter with reality. Science is concerned with impersonal encounter. This is a realm in which experience can be manipulated and repeated as often as desired…. The attempt to manipulate God and put God to the test is the sinful error of magic. It is in this rich and profound realm of personal and transpersonal experience that religion pursues its quest for truth.” (Polkinghorne, pg 158)

There seems to be grey area where both science and the Bible can not only coexist but thrive. “ It is historical criticism that enables us to place the Bible and evolution (science) _together_, both functioning without compromise or apology in the development of a worldview that is far richer than one alone can enable.” (Smiles, pg 56) 

### Does Science Prove the Bible?

%}

Despite the thought of Science and the Bible sticking to their own corners and keeping intersection to a minimum there has been some scientific discoveries that may be evidence of the Bible. The biggest one for the Bible is the **Cambrian Explosion**. This talks about the  discovery of fossils of complex organisms in the Cambrian period. What makes this discovery interesting is the lack of evidence of fossils in the period before it showing any signs of evolution. Basically these complex organismed appeared at the same geological level all over the world. How can this be explained? The church points to the global flood described in the Bible (Genesis chapters 6-9). 

### Conclusion
Historiography is different discipline from history. In history a great amount of time is spent dissecting primary and secondary sources in an effort to learn the truth about what happened 
If your looking for a winner in the battle between **Bible and Science** you are not going to find one. The best answer your going to get is that they agree to disagree. There is no way to completely discredit the one and call another the champion. We can look at their relationship and look at how they pushed each other to get better. Neither Science or the Bible could stand pat and not look for advancement. It is because of these two constantly battling that we all have enjoyed the fruits of their advancements. How it has shaped our society and given options for everyone to believe in what they so choose.
